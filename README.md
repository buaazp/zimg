### SSL

zimg.lua增加了对SSL相关配置
    
    --SSL
    pemfile = "server.crt"
    privfile = "server.key"
    cafile = "ca.crt"

### Versions:
- 09/09/2014 - zimg 3.1.0 Release. New generation.
- 04/26/2014 - zimg 2.0.0 Release. Supported distributed storage backends.
- 08/01/2013 - zimg 1.0.0 Release.

### Synopsis
- The zimg is an image storage and processing server. You can get a compressed and scaled image from zimg with the parameters of URL.  
http://demo.buaa.us/5f189d8ec57f5a5a0d3dcba47fa797e2?w=500&h=500&g=1&x=0&y=0&r=45&q=75&f=jpeg

- The parameters contain width, height, resize type, gray, crop postion (x, y), rotate, quality and format. And you can control the default type of images by configuration file.  
And you can get the information of image in zimg server like this:  
http://demo.buaa.us/info?md5=5f189d8ec57f5a5a0d3dcba47fa797e2

- If you want to customize the transform rule of image you can write a zimg-lua script. Goto [API of zimg-lua](http://zimg.buaa.us/documents/api_of_zimg_lua/) for more information. Use `t=type` parameter in your URL to get the special image:  
http://demo.buaa.us/5f189d8ec57f5a5a0d3dcba47fa797e2?t=webp500

- The concurrent I/O, distributed storage and in time processing ability of zimg is excellent. You needn't nginx in your image server any more. In the benchmark test, zimg can deal with 3000+ image downloading task per second and 90000+ HTTP echo request per second on a high concurrency level. The performance is higher than PHP or other image processing server. More infomation of zimg is in the documents below.

### Supplying:
Uploading, downloading and processing images through HTTP protocol.  
High performance in concurrency I/O and compressing image.  
Support lua scripts to deal with customize compressing strategy.  
Support memcached and redis protocols to save images into distributed storage backends.  
Varied config options for operation and maintenance.  

More usages are in [Guidebook of zimg](http://zimg.buaa.us/documents/guidebook/).

### Build:
You should build dependences first. If you want to use distributed storage, make sure the optional storage backends beansdb(memcached protocol), or ssdb(redis protocol) is working well.  
More infomation of building zimg is in [Install Guide](http://zimg.buaa.us/documents/install/).
 
```
git clone https://github.com/buaazp/zimg -b master --depth=1
cd zimg   
make  
cd bin  
./zimg conf/zimg.lua
```
